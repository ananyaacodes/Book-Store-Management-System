**A modular Python + MySQL bookstore management system** — inventory,
staff records, purchases, and admin controls, wrapped in a clean
menu-driven CLI.

## 🔎 Overview

This started as a first year single-file script and has since been
rebuilt into a proper modular application: six focused Python modules,
parameterized SQL everywhere, hashed passwords, a real admin login
system, and automatic invoice generation on every sale.

## ✨ Features

- Add new books to inventory
- Add / remove / view staff records
- View & reset sales history
- View total income
- View available stock

</td>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

### 👤 Buyer
- Sign up & log in (hashed passwords)
- Purchase books → auto-generated invoice
- Search by name, genre, or author
- View available books
- View staff directory

## 🏗️ Architecture

<div align="center">
<img src="assets/architecture.png" alt="Module architecture diagram" width="100%" />
</div>

Six modules, each with one job — no more 400-line single file:

| Module | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `config.py` | Loads DB credentials from environment variables |
| `db.py` | Connection handling + parameterized query helpers |
| `auth.py` | PBKDF2 password hashing, buyer login, admin login |
| `inventory.py` | Add / search / view books |
| `staff.py` | Staff record management |
| `sales.py` | Purchases, sell history, income, invoice generation |
| `main.py` | Entry point — menus and program flow |

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone & install dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ananyaacodes/Book-Store-Management-System.git
cd Book-Store-Management-System
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configure your database credentials

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

```env
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password_here
DB_NAME=bookstore
```

`.env` is git-ignored, so your real credentials never get committed.

### 3. Run it

```bash
python main.py
```

Tables are created automatically on first run. You'll also be
prompted to create the first **admin account** the very first time
you launch the program.

---

## 🗄️ Database Setup

Create the database once — everything else is handled for you:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE bookstore;
```

`db.ensure_schema()` creates all five tables on first run:
`available_books`, `staff_details`, `sell_rec`, `signup`, and
`admin_credentials`.

## 🔐 Security

This refactor closed the gaps a typical first-pass CRUD project has:

- **No more SQL injection** — every query uses parameterized
  placeholders (`%s`) instead of f-string-built SQL.
- **No more hardcoded credentials** — DB password lives in a
  git-ignored `.env` file, loaded via `config.py`.
- **No more plaintext passwords** — buyer and admin passwords are
  hashed with **PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256** (200,000 iterations, random
  16-byte salt per user) before touching the database.
- **Real admin gate** — the staff menu now requires a genuine login
  instead of being open to anyone who picks "Employee Login."
